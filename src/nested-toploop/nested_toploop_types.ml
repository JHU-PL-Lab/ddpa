        non-empty, then the remaining components of the result will be empty. *)

    (** An association list from each requested variable analysis to the
        possible values of that variable under those conditions.  If no
        analyses were requested or if the expression was ill-formed, this
        list will be empty. *)

        core toploop analysis.  If no error checking was requested or if the
        expression was ill-formed, this list will be empty. *)

        if evaluation was disabled, if error checking was enabled and discovered
        errors, or if the expression was ill-formed. *)
